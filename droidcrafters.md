## 📝Description

The VJTI Hostels are completely managed by the hostel staff on pen and 
registers. This results into, at times loss of data and confusion. Moreover, the in-out 
entries for students are not regularly audited. 
To overcome this problem, a Hostel Management System is to be developed 
that has the following major features: 
• Hostel registration form filling
• Room allotment Data
• In-out data
• Leave application data
• Room chage data
• Complaint Box
• Hostel notice board
• Attendance through App
• Guest allotment 
• Hostel Facilities 
• Room change applications
